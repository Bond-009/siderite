# Siderite

[![travis-ci Build Status][travis-ci-badge]][travis-ci-page]

A Minecraft 1.8.9 server written in Rust. (WIP)

State       | Status
------------|-------
Handshaking | Works
Status      | Works, but sends no favicon and a dummy sample
Login       | Works, but encryption seems borked
Play        | Handles just enough packets to not crash
